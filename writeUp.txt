Execution:
1) Open the project folder in any IDE
2) Run the server_gui.java file: This file generates a Graphical USer Interface for the server and makes it listen to incoming client requests
3) Run client_gui.java, client2_gui.java , client3_gui.java individually in IDE.
4) Enter your names in second textfield of the client gui and then the Server GUI window will show the users connected in realtime.
5) Client GUI is used to send yes/no to either generate a number or not. This is done in second textfield of the client GUI.
6) Output from the server is shown in the third textfield of the client GUI. The total number of seconds waited by the client program is displayed in this field.
